Workflow assumptions

- Inputs are fastq not bam (the RESORTBAM os not active)
- Temporary files are not removed (the REMOVETEMPFILES is not active)
- The AnisimovLauncher is not used in this workflow

New and changed parameters and meanings:
- PBSWALLTIME : wall time for the job (still need to account for this in the workflow code)
- PBSCORES: instead of PBSTHREADS
- PBSQUEUE: instead of PBSQUEUEEXOME
- TMPDIR: folder for temporary files
- MAP_CUTOFF: Minimum quality cutoff
- DUP_CUTOFF: Maximum duplication level cutoff
- BWADIR : Directory of the BWA MEM
- CHRNAMES: Instead of CHRINDEX to represent the crhomosomes/ contigs under consideration
- SAMPLEINFORMATION: This entry was repeated twice in the original file. Just keep the entry directing to the sampleinfo file

Code changes:
- pbs.MERGE
- Use the variable alignjobid : instead of jobid, and save to pbs.ALIGN and pbs.summary_dependencies (to solve problems in deducing the right pbs job id in the queue)

To do:
- The old pipeline assumes that all tools are module loaded first then called directly. For more generality, the complete path of each tool is specified instead: SAMMODULE is replaced with SAMDIR, and the variable name is samtools. Still need to check the full path of each tool and update that the executable actually exists
