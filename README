Workflow assumptions

- Inputs are fastq not bam (the RESORTBAM os not active)
- Temporary files are not removed (the REMOVETEMPFILES is not active)
- The AnisimovLauncher is not used in this workflow

New and changed parameters and meanings:
- PBSWALLTIME : wall time for the job (still need to account for this in the workflow code)
- PBSCORES: instead of PBSTHREADS
- PBSQUEUE: instead of PBSQUEUEEXOME
- TMPDIR: folder for temporary files
- MAP_CUTOFF: Minimum quality cutoff
- DUP_CUTOFF: Maximum duplication level cutoff
- BWADIR : Directory of the BWA MEM
- CHRNAMES: Instead of CHRINDEX to represent the crhomosomes/ contigs under consideration (The existing names are approapriate for use with soybeans as is)
- SAMPLEINFORMATION: This entry was repeated twice in the original file. Just keep the entry directing to the sampleinfo file

Code changes:
- pbs.MERGE
- Use the variable alignjobid : instead of jobid, and save to pbs.ALIGN and pbs.summary_dependencies (to solve problems in deducing the right pbs job id in the queue)
- ALIGNERTOOL: checks for the tools used for alignment (instead of the variable ALIGNER 
- gatkdir: this is introduced instead of gatk_dir
- NOVOCRAFT is introduced as replacement for NOVOSORT to allow for the use of both novoalign and novosort



To do:
- The old pipeline assumes that all tools are module loaded first then called directly. For more generality, the complete path of each tool is specified instead: SAMMODULE is replaced with SAMDIR, and the variable name is samtools. Still need to check the full path of each tool and update that the executable actually exists. So far, the following paths have been integrated:
-	BWAMEMDIR
-	SAMTOOLSDIR
-	NOVOCRAFTDIR
-	SAMBLASTERDIR (just to allow the option, not sure if will be of value)
- 	all mentions of configuration file shoule be changed to runfile


Mistakes in previous README update:
- The variable SCRIPTDIR is actually needed in this workflow. Its proper use is now documented
- The variable BWAINDEX is actually needed. It points to the indexed reference genome, and should be passed to the align_dedup.sh
